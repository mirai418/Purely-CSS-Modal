Purely-CSS-Modal
================

A demonstration of a purely CSS based modal pop-up.

The CSS3 "+" function can apply changes to elements in the DOM using a different element.
In case of a div, the + can be used for the next closest neighbour element.

The structure of the HTML is important in order for this to work.

By using SASS (http://sass-lang.com/) it is possible to make the modal size a variable and adapt it to different areas on the website
